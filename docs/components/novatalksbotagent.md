	> (for node-red flows variables ga4measurementId (MEASUREMENT_ID) and ga4apiSecret (API_SECRET) must be set in global variables)

	- Subflow input fields:
	
		1. **eventName**: name of the event which would be sent to Google Analytics

		2. **messanger**: transport of the message; took from the **msg** object
